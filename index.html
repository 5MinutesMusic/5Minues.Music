        <h1 class="display-5">Why do we Love & Learn Music !</h1>
        <p class="lead">Music makes us more sensitive and more beautiful and
          more compassionate and human. In short, music gives a nominal meaning
          to life. That's why we learn and learn music. It is a specific minute
          and requires an acoustic precision and we see all of this reflected in
          the guide of the orchestra leader, which contains the badges of frequency,
          intensity levels of sound,and the amounts of change of sounds, melody and
          rhythm, all at one time with great accuracy in time control. It is based on
          dividing time in a balanced and harmonious manner into smaller parts and doing
          so immediately. Music reflects the nature of the environment in which it originated
          and often gives a fingerprint to specific countries or ethnic groups Most of the terms
          are in Italian, German or French, and of course we do not mean the same music blogging.
          Music labels are a complex type of shorthand composed of multiple symbols to represent
          voices in a written manner. Thus, the language of music is the most complete and universal
          language among the languages ​​of the world. Fingers, arms, arms, lips, cheeks and facial muscles,
          as well as the need for exceptional control of the diaphragm, back, stomach and chest muscles,
          which must react quickly. Music is all that together, but most of all music is an art that allows
          man to take all these dry, complex and boring techniques sometimes and then use them to create passion.
