                <h5 class="card-title">Electric Guitar</h5>
                <p class="card-text">An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes. 
                  It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. 
                  The sound can be shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities, making it quite different than an acoustic guitar. 
                  Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion, and "overdrive"; the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.
                  Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. 
                  Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. 
                  During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.
                  It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to country music, blues, and jazz. 
                  It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music, and many other genres of music.
                  Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. 
                  Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players "bend" the pitch of notes or chords up or down or perform vibrato effects. 
                  The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.
                  There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar; various types of hollow-body guitars; the six-string guitar (the most common type), which is usually tuned E, B, G, D, A, E, from highest to lowest strings; the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E; the eight-string guitar, which typically adds a low E or F# string below the low B; and the twelve-string guitar, which has six pairs of strings.   
                  In pop and rock music, the electric guitar is often used in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which plays the chord sequences or progressions, and riffs, and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section); and as a lead guitar, which provides instrumental melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos. 
                  In a small group, such as a power trio, one guitarist switches between both roles. 
                  In large rock and metal bands, there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist.

                <p class="card-text">Harp, a stringed instrument in which the resonator, or belly,
                  is perpendicular, or nearly so, to the plane of the strings. Each string produces
                  one note, the gradation of string length from short to long corresponding to that
                  from high to low pitch. The resonator is usually of wood or skin. In arched, or 
                  bow-shaped, harps the neck extends from and forms a curve with the body. In angular
                  harps, the body, and neck form an angle. In frame harps (mostly confined to Europe),
                  the body and neck are set at an angle and are connected by a column, pillar, or fore
                  pillar, that braces against the tension of the strings. Harps lacking a fore pillar
                  are strung at relatively low tension, which results in a lower pitch than frame harps.
                  The modern double-action pedal harp combines the basic structure and sound of ancient
                  harps with a complex mechanism in order to obtain a fully chromatic range.

                <p class="card-text">The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. 
                  The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet.
                  Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BCE. 
                  They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.
                  Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.
                  Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.
                  There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). 
                  Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. 
                  There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1–2 combination. 
                  Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. 
                  The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. 
                  Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. 
                  A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.

                <h5 class="card-title">Clarinet</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments. It has a 
                  single-reed mouthpiece, a straight, cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical
                  bore, and a flared bell.A person who plays the clarinet is called a clarinetist
                  (sometimes spelled clarinetist).During the Late Baroque era, composers such as 
                  Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who 
                  were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came
                  to be called, clarion register.Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or 
                  pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the 
                  trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales
                  of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register. 
                  The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term clarino and this,
                  in turn, came to apply to the musicians themselves.It is probable that the term clarinet
                  may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and it has been 
                  suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly
                  difficult passages on these newly developed "mock trumpets".</p>

                  of woodwind instruments usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece.
                  Although most saxophones are made from brass, they are categorized as woodwind instruments,
                  because the sound is produced by an oscillating reed (traditionally made out of woody cane)
                  rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family. 
                  As with the other woodwind instruments, the pitch of the note being played is controlled
                  by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column
                  by changing the effective length of the tube.The player covers or uncovers the holes
                  by pressing keys.The saxophone is used in classical music (such as concert bands,
                  chamber music, solo repertoire, and, occasionally, orchestras), military bands, 
                  marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. 
                  The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn 
                  section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music.Saxophone players are called saxophonists.

                <p class="card-text">The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group.
                  Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening.  
                  Flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments, as paleolithic examples with hand-bored holes have been found. 
                  A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany.
                  These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.
                  While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day. 
                  In China, a playable bone flute was discovered, dated approximately 9000 years old.
                  The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5000 years and Labrador dating back approximately 7500 years.
                  Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well, especially in China and India. 
                  Flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. 
                  He said that religious artwork depicting "celestial music" instruments was linked to music with an "aristocratic character."
                  The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, and he is depicted in Hindu art with the instrument.
                  In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century A.D. at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd-4th centuries A.D.
                  Although there had been flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, in more recent millenia the flute was absent from the subcontinent until its arrival from Asia, by way of "North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia," according to historian Alexander Buchner.
                  The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century.
                  Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 A.D.
                  The transverse flute had spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known as the German flute.

                <p class="card-text">The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. 
                  As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. 
                  Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. 
                  However, many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument. 
                  Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.
                  The word "trombone" derives from Italian Tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning "large"), so the name means (large trumpet). 
                  The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the baritone, in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the cornet, the euphonium, and the French horn. 
                  The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. 
                  The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B♭, an octave below the B♭ trumpet and an octave above the pedal B♭ tuba. 
                  The once common E♭ alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. 
                  Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B♭ transposing instrument, written in treble clef.
                  A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player.

                <h5 class="card-title">Oboe</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The oboe is a type of double reed woodwind instrument.
                  Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic materials, such as plastic, resin or hybrid composites. 
                  The most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range. 
                  A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm (25 1⁄2 in) long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell. 
                  Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure, causing it to vibrate with the air column.
                  The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as "bright".
                  When the word oboe is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family, such as the bass oboe, the cor anglais (English horn), or oboe d'amore.
                  A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist.
                  Today, the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras, concert bands and chamber ensembles.
                  The oboe is especially used in classical music, film music, some genres of folk music, and is occasionally heard in jazz, rock, pop, and popular music.
                  The oboe is widely recognized as the instrument that tunes the orchestra with its distinctive 'A'.

                <p class="card-text">The piccolo is a half-size flute and a member of the woodwind
                  family of musical instruments.The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings
                  as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces
                  is an octave higher than written.This gave rise to the name Ottaviano 
                  (Italian for "little octave"), which the instrument is called in the scores of
                  Italian composers.It is also called flauto piccolo or flautino.
                  In the orchestral setting, the piccolo player is often designated as
                  "piccolo/flute III", or even "assistant principal". 
                  The larger orchestras have designated this position as a solo position due to the
                  demands of the literature.Piccolos are often orchestrated to double the violins
                  or the flutes, adding sparkle and brilliance to the overall sound because of the
                  aforementioned one-octave transposition upwards.In concert band settings, the 
                  piccolo is almost always used and a piccolo part is almost always available.
