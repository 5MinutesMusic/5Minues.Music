                <p> The saxophone (referred to colloquially as the sax) is a family of
                  woodwind instruments usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece.
                  Although most saxophones are made from brass, they are categorized as woodwind instruments,
                  because sound is produced by an oscillating reed (traditionally made out of woody cane)
                  rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family.
                  As with the other woodwind instruments, the pitch of the note being played is controlled
                  by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by
                  changing the effective length of the tube.
                  The player covers or uncovers the holes by pressing keys.</p>

                <p>The clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece,
                  a straight, cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell.
                  A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).
                  Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany
                  around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C.
                  Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.</p>

                <p> The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles.
                  The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the
                  brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard Bâ™­ or C Trumpet.
                  Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands,
                  and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air
                  through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing"
                  sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.
                  Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing,
                  usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.</p>

                  <p>The violin is a wooden chordophone (string instrument)
                    Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
                    It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.
                    The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5,
                    and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings.
                    It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized
                    cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).
                    The Word Violin comes from Latin.

                  <p>Viola means string instrument
                    The Viola is 7 cm longer than the Violin, and has the same shape and the same method of playing.
                    The difference is in size and in the places where the tones are placed on the strings.
                    The viola sound is closer to the sound of the Cello than the sound of the violin, but its shape is
                    closer to the Violin, therefore it is considered as middle instrument between the both.
                    In the orchestral pieces, the viola places directly in front of the orchestral conductor while the
                    violin places on his left.</p>

                      The Cello strings are longer and his sound is less sharp than the Violin and Viola.</p>

                      In addition to being a main instrument in the classical orchestra, it is widely used in bands and
                      jazz music.
                      The contrabass is rarely played alone, it always accompanies the other instruments.</p>
