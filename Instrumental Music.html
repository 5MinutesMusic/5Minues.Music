                  wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular
                  use.
                  The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and
                  is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the
                  strings
                  with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases,by striking the strings with the wooden side of
                  the
                  bow (col legno).The Word Violin comes from Latin.

                  The viola sound is closer to the sound of the Cello than the sound of the violin, but its shape is
                  closer to the Violin, therefore it is considered as middle instrument between the both.
