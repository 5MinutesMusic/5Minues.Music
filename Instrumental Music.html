                <h5 class="card-title">Electric Guitar</h5>
                <p class="card-text">An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes. 
                  It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. 
                  The sound can be shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities, making it quite different than an acoustic guitar. 
                  Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion, and "overdrive"; the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.
                  Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. 
                  Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. 
                  During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.
                  It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to country music, blues, and jazz. 
                  It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music, and many other genres of music.
                  Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. 
                  Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players "bend" the pitch of notes or chords up or down or perform vibrato effects. 
                  The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.
                  There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar; various types of hollow-body guitars; the six-string guitar (the most common type), which is usually tuned E, B, G, D, A, E, from highest to lowest strings; the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E; the eight-string guitar, which typically adds a low E or F# string below the low B; and the twelve-string guitar, which has six pairs of strings.   
                  In pop and rock music, the electric guitar is often used in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which plays the chord sequences or progressions, and riffs, and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section); and as a lead guitar, which provides instrumental melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos. 
                  In a small group, such as a power trio, one guitarist switches between both roles. 
                  In large rock and metal bands, there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist.

                <h5 class="card-title">Harp</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Harp, a stringed instrument in which the resonator, or belly,
                   is perpendicular, or nearly so, to the plane of the strings. Each string produces
                    one note, the gradation of string length from short to long corresponding to that
                     from high to low pitch. The resonator is usually of wood or skin. In arched, or 
                     bow-shaped, harps the neck extends from and forms a curve with the body. In angular
                      harps, the body, and neck form an angle. In frame harps (mostly confined to Europe),
                       the body and neck are set at an angle and are connected by a column, pillar, or fore
                        pillar, that braces against the tension of the strings. Harps lacking a fore pillar
                         are strung at relatively low tension, which results in a lower pitch than frame harps.
                          The modern double-action pedal harp combines the basic structure and sound of ancient
                           harps with a complex mechanism in order to obtain a fully chromatic range.

                  is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the
                  strings
                  with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases,by striking the strings with the wooden side of
